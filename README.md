## Social Network

Groovy implementation of a PoC for a Generalised Social Network- connecting users based on their relationship with other users and their interests in the Network.

Disjktras Shortest Path Algorithm to solve the problem of finding the shortest path of one user to another and BFS to aggregate the results into a collection of RelationshipSuggestions for a given user (the `source` node).

### What's next?
Considering we can prove a PoC like the one detailed in this repository, we could further abstract the implementation for use in other problems, E.g. 

`Customer`s that frequent a `Restaurant` or Food Chain- how are the customers _connected_ and what attributes of the customers are _common_ amongst the clientele. 
We could programmatically solve this and offer insights to the owner of the `Restaurant` and encourage them to consider certain aspects of their offerings and possibly increase efficiency in their marketing and approach to increasing their customer base.
